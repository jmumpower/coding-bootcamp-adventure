# Coding Bootcamp Adventure

Welcome to **Coding Bootcamp Adventure**, an interactive text-based game where you step into the shoes of a coding bootcamp student. Your goal? Navigate through your first days at bootcamp, manage your time wisely, and survive the intense challenges of learning to code—without burning out!

## Game Overview

In **Coding Bootcamp Adventure**, you’ll make decisions to shape your journey. Will you be the star student who aces every project, or will you face burnout from too much work and not enough play? Along the way, you can network with fellow students, attend classes, grab a coffee, or even take part in special events like team projects or coding challenges.

The game is set in a **cyberpunk-inspired world**, featuring neon colors, a futuristic atmosphere, and an engaging storyline with multiple paths to success (or failure). Your stats, including energy, focus, and motivation, will constantly fluctuate based on your choices. Manage them carefully to avoid burnout and achieve success!
